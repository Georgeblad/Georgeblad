## Hi — I’m Jorge 👋  

Independent **full-stack & automation engineer** and **NetSuite developer**.  
I build **automation-heavy web apps, integrations, and internal tools** that remove boring manual work.

---

### What I do

- **Full-stack web development**  
  TypeScript · React/Next.js · Node.js · REST/GraphQL APIs · PostgreSQL/Supabase

- **Business automation & scripting**  
  Backend services, CLIs, browser extensions, and scripts that glue systems together and keep data flowing.

- **NetSuite customization & integrations**  
  SuiteScript 1.0/2.x · SuiteQL · SDF · RESTlets · EDI flows via integration platforms.

- **Technical ownership for clients**  
  From discovery and architecture → to implementation, documentation, and hand-off to in-house teams.

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, Python, SuiteScript, a bit of PHP
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, browser extensions
